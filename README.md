# Store_Sales_Analysis_using_PowerBI_SQL_and_Python_
📊 Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to analyze the sales data of a fictional superstore in order to extract meaningful insights that can drive smarter business decisions. 
Key challenges addressed include:- 
- Cleaning and preparing raw sales data
- Performing detailed exploratory analysis
- Designing intuitive visual dashboards for stakeholders

✅ Solution Overview:
To solve the problem, a combination of tools and techniques were used across the full data analysis pipeline:

- Python (Pandas) was used for cleaning, formatting, and preprocessing the original Excel dataset, which was then saved as a CSV.
- The cleaned CSV file was imported into a MySQL database using a custom schema designed to support efficient querying.
- SQL queries were written to explore the data, identify trends, and extract key metrics.
- Power BI was used to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard, offering insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product analytics.

📈 What the Project Demonstrates:
This project showcases end-to-end proficiency in:
🔹 Data cleaning and transformation using Python
🔹 Relational modeling and SQL-based data exploration
🔹 Interactive reporting with Power BI

The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Sales Performance: Monthly revenue, top-selling regions, and profit breakdowns.
- Customer Analysis: Segments, regions, and customer behavior trends.
- Product Analysis: Category-wise sales, profit margins, and discounts.
